# NetAS-Network-Assistant
A Gui that you can run cmd commands build with [AutoIT](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/). You can download the executable from [here](https://github.com/Gexos/NetAS-Network-Assistant/releases)

This is a small tool I built with AutoIT, it has embedded 12 networking cmd commands, I use these commands very often in my work so I build this tool. You can run any command from inside the Gui.

## Requirements
If you want to run/compile the script you need to have AutoIT installed on your machine.
## Virus Alert
AV companies often mark any Compiled script as virus for the simple fact they check on the included runtime module in stead of the real script section.
There is a simple reason why AutoIt3 is used to write illigal stuff because it is so damn simply to do.
