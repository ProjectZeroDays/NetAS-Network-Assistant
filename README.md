# NetAS-Network-Assistant
A Gui that you can run cmd commands build with [AutoIT](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/). You can download the executable from [here](https://github.com/Gexos/NetAS-Network-Assistant/releases/download/v1.1/networkassistant.exe)

This is a small tool I built with AutoIT, it has embedded 10 networking cmd commands, I use these commands very often in my work
so I build this tool. You can run any command from inside the Gui.

AV companies often mark any Compiled script as virus for the simple fact they check on the included runtime module in stead of the real script section.
There is a simple reason why AutoIt3 is used to write illigal stuff because it is so damn simply to do.
